TODO: This needs to be removed from all of the books that reference it and be updated for the Open edX community.

Most current browsers will work on edX.org. For best performance, we recommend the latest versions of:

* `Chrome`_
* `Firefox`_

We also support the latest versions of:

* `Microsoft Edge`_
* `Safari`_


.. note:: If you use the Safari browser, be aware that it does not support the
 search feature for the guides on `docs.edx.org`_. This is a known limitation.
